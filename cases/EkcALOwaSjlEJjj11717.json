      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The patient's right eye retinal image reveals a vitreous hemorrhage most likely occurring secondary to a history of longstanding diabetic retinopathy. Uncontrolled diabetes is the most common cause of vitreous hemorrhaging in adults (while trauma is the leading cause in young people). In these cases, bleeding into the vitreous occurs due to the leakage of blood from abnormal new blood vessel growth (neovascularization), as these vessels are weaker and more prone to breakage compared to the normal retinal vasculature. Patients presenting with a vitreous hemorrhage will typically complain of a sudden, painless decrease in visual acuity. Symptoms can range from a complete loss of vision (e.g. inability to perceive hand motion) to the appearance of black spots, cobwebs, or haziness of vision. Posterior segment evaluation will reveal red blood cells in the vitreous body that may also be detected in the anterior vitreous. In cases of severe hemorrhaging, the red reflex of the retina may be absent, there may be no observable view of the fundus, and a mild relative afferent pupillary defect may also be present. In mild to moderate cases, the fundus may be partially obscured. Depending on the etiology of the vitreous hemorrhage, there are usually other associated fundus abnormalities that can be observed in the ipsilateral and contralateral eye (this may also aid in the confirmation of the diagnosis). Other possible differential diagnoses of a vitreous hemorrhage are explained below: • Central retinal vein occlusion: diffuse retinal hemorrhages in all four quadrants of the retina with associated dilated and tortuous retinal veins ° Cotton-wool spots, retinal edema, optic disc edema, optociliary shunt vessels, and neovascularization may also be present • Preretinal hemorrhage: leakage of blood into either the subhyaloid space between the posterior vitreous face and retina, or beneath the internal limiting membrane ° Usually presents with a boat-shaped hemorrhage which obscures the underlying retina • Malignant hypertension: hard exudates in a macular star formation, optic nerve edema, flame-shaped retinal hemorrhages, retinal edema, and cotton-wool spots are commonly observed ° Requires immediate medical treatment • Valsalva retinopathy: single or multiple hemorrhages beneath the internal limiting membrane, most commonly noted in the area of the macula ° Usually associated with a history of heavy lifting, coughing, vomiting, or straining • Ocular ischemic syndrome: mid-peripheral retinal hemorrhages with dilated and irregular retinal veins ° Disc neovascularization may be present ° Patients commonly have a history of transient visual loss, transient ischemic attacks, or orbital pain"

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The following considerations represent indications for a vitrectomy as the initial treatment of choice in certain cases of a unilateral vitreous hemorrhage secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy: • Patient's need for improved vision to function (usually a monocular patient or a patient whose fellow eye has severely reduced vision) • Non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage persisting for 3-6 months • Associated tractional retinal detachment (or combined rhegmatogenous and tractional retinal detachment) • Refractory diabetic macular edema • Severe premacular subhyaloid hemorrhage • Vitreopapillary traction • High-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy with anterior segment neovascularization • Ghost-cell glaucoma In cases of severe vitreous hemorrhaging, panretinal photocoagulation cannot be performed due to obscuration of the retina by blood in the vitreous cavity. Vitrase® is purified bovine hyaluronidase that has been shown to promote absorption of a vitreous hemorrhage by causing the vitreous to liquefy, thereby promoting the clearance of blood; however, this treatment is not FDA-approved and is not widely used. In most cases of a vitreous hemorrhage secondary to diabetic retinopathy with none of the above associated findings, treatment involves close monitoring of the patient, as the condition commonly resolves without medical treatment within a period of a few months. Bed rest for the first few days is usually recommended in order to reduce the chance of recurrent bleeding, while also allowing the blood to begin to settle inferiorly, offering a better view of the fundus."
