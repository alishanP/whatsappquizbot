      "explanation": "A diagnosis of divergence insufficiency is based on the following: • Esophoria that is greater at distance than near • Frequency of eso deviation is worse at distance than near • Eso fixation disparity at distance • Decreased second degree fusion at far (suppression or diplopia) • Low AC/A ratio • Decreased negative fusional vergence ranges at distance • Deviation is comitant (as opposed to a 6th nerve palsy) • Symptoms include headaches, eyestrain, and intermittent diplopia at distance ° Gradual in nature (not sudden) ° Symptoms worsen with fatigue and improve with rest Divergence insufficiency is the least common vergence condition (0.1% of the population). Because of this, it must be differentiated from other possible serious neurological disorders such as divergence paralysis or a 6th cranial nerve palsy. • In cases of a 6th nerve palsy, the eye cannot abduct on extraocular muscle evaluation ° A 6th nerve palsy is non-comitant when measured in all fields of gaze ° Negative fusional vergence ranges will likely be decreased at near as well as distance ° End-point nystagmus may be present • Divergence paralysis is an acute issue that is usually secondary to head trauma, multiple sclerosis, brainstem damage, etc. ° It occurs suddenly with marked esotropia at distance ° A-pattern eso deviation may be present • In both 6th nerve palsies and divergence paralysis, the eso deviation does not increase when the patient is tired or decrease when well rested. Papilledema may also appear. In these cases, patients may present with other neurological symptoms such as dizziness, lethargy, vomiting, irritability, gait disturbances, and distal paresthesia."

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "For this patient, prescribing glasses with the subjective refraction data will have virtually no effect on ocular alignment due to the low AC/A ratio associated with divergence insufficiency. ° If additional minus lenses are added to the distance prescription, this will actually increase the amount of the esophoria at distance, likely making the patient's symptoms worse ° This occurs because minus lenses stimulate accommodation, which also leads to convergence through the AC/A ratio ° If additional plus lenses are added to the distance prescription, they may decrease the amount of the esophoria; however, they will induce distance blur ° Because the AC/A ratio is low, in order to create a significant effect on the distance phoria, a substantial amount of plus is needed (which would lead to significant distance blur) Vision therapy for patients with divergence insufficiency is challenging, and the prognosis for these cases is typically worse than for those with other binocular vision conditions, such as divergence excess, convergence insufficiency, and convergence excess. ° It is very difficult to train divergence, especially at distance Therefore, treatment with prism is the best option for patients with divergence insufficiency. Patients may undergo a combination of prism and vision therapy; however, prism tends to be the more effective treatment. ° Because the deviation is eso, the patient will require base-out prism ° Base-in prism will only cause the deviation to get worse (should be used in exo deviations)"
