        }
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Attenuation of the retinal pigment epithelium may lead to loss of melanin granules, allowing for increased visibility of the underlying choroid. RPE defects, also known as \"window defects\", appear as yellow-white, well-demarcated, circular lesions that usually present in the mid-peripheral retina. These benign lesions will not present with any associated RPE hyperplasia or surrounding retinal edema. Acquired retinal conditions that can lead to RPE window defects may include vascular abnormalities, inflammation, age-related macular degeneration, Best disease, choroideremia, trauma, tumors, macular holes, rubella, and sub-RPE neovascularization. RPE window defects may also occur secondary to the use of certain medications such as thioridazine. Given the case history, the lack of retinal pathology, and the presentation of the lesion, this patient’s RPE defect is likely due to a physiological variation of the RPE. Gyrate atrophy is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder. It begins as RPE and choroidal atrophy with scalloped borders in the mid-peripheral fundus. It is estimated that 80-98% of patients also have progressive myopia. Areas of the retina are hyperpigmented near atrophic zones. With time, areas of atrophy may coalesce, and peripheral visual field loss increases. Gyrate atrophy is associated with hyperornithinemia (an amino acid defect in the mitochondria) and reduced serum lysine levels. This patient does not possess field loss, is not myopic, and the defect is unilateral. In addition, the patient did not report any signs of nyctalopia (night blindness), which is a common symptom in patients with this condition. Cobblestone degeneration, also known as pavingstone degeneration, is a thinning or atrophy of the peripheral retina, retinal pigment epithelium, and choriocapillaris. It is more commonly observed in myopic patients. The areas of atrophy appear circular and are white/yellow in color due to depigmentation. There is usually an associated halo of pigment surrounding the thinned areas. These lesions may coalesce together to form a large band of atrophy. The condition is typically observed bilaterally. The RPE defect observed in this patient does not possess RPE hyperplasia around its borders, which is characteristic of cobblestone degeneration. Additionally, the sclera may be visible in pavingstone degeneration, which is also not evident in this patient’s retinal image. Retinal holes will typically appear red or brown in color and are often surrounded by hyperplasia of the RPE, or by a cuff of retinal edema. Geographic atrophy is an advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration."

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Given the patient’s exam findings and chief complaint, she is most likely suffering from ocular allergies. Lastacaft® is a dual-acting medication that serves as an antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer and is indicated for once daily use. Patanol® and Zaditor® are also classified as dual-acting agents because they block H-1 receptor sites and stabilize mast cells. However, both of these medications are to be used twice daily for effective results. Cromolyn sodium stabilizes mast cells but does not possess the ability to block H-1 receptor sites. Mast cell stabilizers are useful for chronic allergic eye disease, but they have an associated lag time and therefore do not provide instant relief of symptoms. Cromolyn sodium is typically used four to six times daily. Alrex® is a mild steroid that provides relief from symptoms associated with ocular allergies, but it is typically prescribed to be used three to four times a day. Acular® is classified as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and is typically used four times daily. NSAIDs work well for mild to moderate bouts of allergic conjunctivitis."

The optometrist may state that he or she has a special interest in a particular area but may not claim a specialty. When advertising, a clinician must publish his or her professional degree and may not deceive the public. Any optometrist, whether he or she does or does not possess residency training, may fit specialty contact lenses, and may bill for medically necessary contacts as long as the patient qualifies under the specific parameters published by the insurance carrier. Based on the FTC contact lens rule, optometrists must provide all patients with a copy of their contact lens prescription no matter if the lens is considered a specialty lens or not."
