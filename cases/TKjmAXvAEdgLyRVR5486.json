      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Aniridia is the term used for the congenital condition characterized by a lack of an iris. It is genetically inherited and most cases are autosomal dominant in nature. There is no gender or race predilection, and typically, both eyes are affected. There are three different classes of aniridia; AN-1 has an autosomal dominant pattern and is not linked with systemic complications. AN-2 has a sporadic occurrence and possesses a 30% risk of the development of a Wilms tumor by the age of 5. AN-3 is the least common form and is recessively inherited. Patients with AN-3 typically possess an intellectual disability along with cerebellar ataxia. Due to the severity of a Wilms tumor, a careful case and family history in patients with aniridia must be performed. Anisocoria is characterized by a difference in pupil sizes. Anisometropia is defined as the condition in which the refractive error is unequal between the two eyes. Aniseikonia is defined as the condition in which there is a significant difference in perceived retinal images between the two eyes."

Nystagmus, corneal pannus, foveal hypoplasia, and strabismus have also been correlated with aniridia. Additionally, in 28-50% of cases, glaucoma has been reported. Lens opacities have also been reported in 50-85% of cases of aniridia."

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Many patients with aniridia exhibit rapid, pendular nystagmus attributable to foveal hypoplasia; however, in this case, nystagmus is absent which better allows for the isolation of the affected cranial nerve. There are 6 muscles and 3 cranial nerves that are responsible for eye movements (CN III, IV, and VI). In addition to pupillary function and innervation of the eyelid, CN III is responsible for 4 extraocular muscles: superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, and inferior oblique. CN IV is responsible for the superior oblique, while CN VI is responsible for the lateral rectus. Upon observation of image 1, you should note that there is a restriction in ABduction of the left eye, indicating an underaction of the lateral rectus. Following Hering's law of equal innervation, the right eye shows an equal overaction of the medial rectus. CN V, also known as the trigeminal nerve, has 3 branches: the ophthalmic branch, the maxillary branch, and the mandibular branch. The ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal is purely sensory and does not have any oculomotor function."

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Due to the patient’s decreased visual acuity, high refractive error, strabismus, and poor vision without correction, it is important to have the patient return for a follow-up visit within 3 months of prescribing glasses to ensure improvement in visual acuity. Additionally, one must remember to check for any accommodative components regarding the esotropia, so re-evaluating binocular vision for improvement with correction is also important."
