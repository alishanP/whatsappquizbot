      ],
      "answer": "F",
      "explanation": "Nocturnal or night myopia is caused by a change in the accommodative response during periods of low illumination. In the absence of a properly resolvable visual stimulus, the accommodative system may return to its resting posture (or dark focus), creating a more myopic refractive error. Night myopia can also occur secondary to mydriasis, which causes an increase in spherical aberration. Lastly, the Purkinje shift is thought to contribute to nocturnal myopia. The Purkinje shift is the switch from photopic vision (mediated by cones) to scotopic vision (rod-based vision). This phenomenon occurs most often in individuals aged 16-25. Symptoms include a decreased ability to read street signs at night, reduced depth perception, and an increase in perceived glare from oncoming traffic. Induced myopia refers to the event in which near-sightedness occurs secondary to a condition, such as fluctuating blood sugar levels, nuclear sclerosis of the lens, or due to a pharmacologic agent. Degenerative myopia is a condition in which there is a high level of myopia due to an increased axial length. The patient has a very mild refractive error; therefore, this is unlikely. Accommodative infacility or pseudomyopia typically presents as temporary decreased distance vision after engaging in prolonged near work."

      ],
      "answer": "E",
      "explanation": "Patients who suffer from nocturnal myopia will usually benefit from single vision minus-powered lenses that are treated with an anti-reflective coating in order to minimize symptoms of blur and glare with night driving. Patients who already wear glasses to neutralize myopia may require a second pair of stronger minus-powered lenses to be used specifically for night driving purposes. To evaluate for nocturnal myopia, visual acuity can be tested in low lighting levels, or dark room retinoscopy may be performed. Contrast sensitivity may also be assessed when a diagnosis of night myopia is suspected. Patients with induced myopia will benefit from removal of the offending agent or evaluation and treatment of the systemic cause. Vision therapy, reading glasses, the instillation of a cycloplegic agent, or a combination of the three may be used to alleviate symptoms associated with pseudomyopia."

        }
      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Spherical aberration occurs when parallel light rays incident on the cornea and lens that are located further away from the visual axis are bent to a greater degree than axial rays, resulting in an image that comes to a point focus in front of the retinal plane. Research has demonstrated that spherical aberration is one of the primary factors associated with reduced visual acuity in nocturnal myopia. Lopez-Gil et al. measured that the refractive state of the eye was more myopic under photopic conditions when observers were shown a point source of light against a dark background as opposed to a black letters against a white background. This difference in the amount of observed myopia was attributable to spherical aberration. Spherical aberration can be minimized by decreasing the size of the aperture/pupil."

Studies have shown that Wellbutrin®, along with several other anti-depressant medications, increase the tendency of suicidal risk and behavior among children, adolescents, and young adults. There does not appear to be an increased risk for individuals older than 24 years of age."
