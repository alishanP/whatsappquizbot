      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This patient’s chief complaint relates to difficulties with near vision following prolonged near activities (blurred vision and occasional headaches). Upon analyzing the patient's visual acuities, refraction (dry and wet), and binocular vision findings, you will find that there are a few abnormal findings that will help you determine his diagnosis and treatment options. Beginning with NRA/PRA, you should note that his PRA measurement is low, and his NRA measurement is slightly high (for a pre-presbyopic patient). Expected NRA values are typically between +2.00 to +2.50 D for any patient, and PRA levels for pre-presbyopic patients are usually anywhere between -2.37 to -3.37 D. This patient’s NRA is +2.75 (slightly elevated) and PRA is -0.75 (reduced). Additionally, this patient's MEM findings also show a \"lag\" of accommodation which typically indicates diagnosis of accommodative dysfunction (but can also mean under-corrected hyperopia, over-corrected myopia, esophoria with insufficient vergence, or presbyopia). MEM values are expected to be between +0.25 to +0.50 (+/- 0.25). Any value higher than +0.75 is considered a “lag” of accommodation, and any value below +0.25 indicates a “lead” of accommodation. Taking into consideration all of the patient's examination findings (entering visual acuities, symptoms, low PRA, lag on MEM, and wet retinoscopy findings), the patient would benefit from a hyperopic correction for near activities. Of the above options, +1.00 DS OU is the most appropriate prescription for this patient and should be prescribed for use during near visual tasks. +1.00 DS OU will balance the NRA/PRA findings and normalize the MEM findings, which should relieve the patient’s symptoms. Because the patient is asymptomatic with distance activities (and has good uncorrected distance visual acuities), the Rx is not required for full-time wear."

      "explanation": "Clinical findings from the case history (itchy eyes, asthma, runny nose, eczema), along with the slit-lamp findings (mild to moderate conjunctival papillae and conjunctival injection) are consistent with the presence of seasonal and atopic allergies (which was also noted in the patient’s medical history). Pataday®, is a topical ophthalmic antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer that is indicated for ocular itching related to allergic conjunctivitis. It is approved for use in the pediatric population over the age of 2; and is therefore the best treatment option for this patient of those listed above. Although Pred Forte® can be an effective treatment for combating ocular inflammation, as well as provide relief from itching, Pred Forte® would not be considered a first-line treatment due to the potential side effects that can be associated with the use of a topical ocular steroid."

There is commonly a family history association, and symptoms usually include intense itching. Clinical signs of vernal keratoconjunctivitis involve the presence of ropy discharge, giant cobblestone papillae, Horner-Trantas dots, and a corneal shield ulcer. In about 50% of patients, keratitis is present."

Alrex® (Loteprednol etabonate 0.2%) is a \"soft\" steroid that helps inhibit the production of arachidonic acid; subsequently reducing the production of the three eicosanoids that can lead to inflammation and are related to the signs of symptoms of this condition."

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Patients who are prescribed steroids should return for a follow-up examination to not only check on their signs and symptoms, but to also monitor intraocular pressures in order to rule out the possibility of a steroid response. However, this patient was not placed on Alrex® but rather Pataday®, so an elevation in IOP is not of concern. Nonetheless, a follow-up is still important to ensure that Pataday® has been an effective treatment for the patient, and that the current plan does not need to be altered. An annual comprehensive examination is also recommended, but ensuring that the patient's allergic symptoms/signs have improved (or have resolved) prior to then is essential."

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Allergic conjunctivitis is an ocular inflammatory condition that is triggered by IgE-induced mast cell and basophil degranulation that occurs in response to an antigen. These cells, once degranulated, release histamine, cytokines, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, interleukins, chemokines and other mediators (early phase), which produce the classic symptoms of itching and redness that are associated with allergic conjunctivitis. In the later phase of the allergic response, infiltration of inflammatory cells such as eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes also occur, with eosinophils predominating. Therefore, if the conjunctival secretions were to be stained, one would likely observe numerous eosinophils. Eosinophils are not typically present in the conjunctival scrapings of normal patients, so their presence is consistent with a diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis."
