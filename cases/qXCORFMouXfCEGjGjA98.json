      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "This patient is most likely experiencing chromatic aberration with his new glasses. This phenomenon can occur when patients switch into a new lens material; particularly polycarbonate. Polycarbonate has many advantages, including impact resistance and a low specific gravity, but this material also possesses a low Abbe value (30), which makes it prone to chromatic aberration (especially if prism is involved). Most patients will not observe color fringes, or will eventually adapt to them; however, if they are exceptionally bothered by the chromatic aberrations, it is best to switch these patients into a lens material that offers a higher Abbe value. Crown glass boasts the overall highest Abbe value of 59, but this lens also has a high specific gravity and is prone to shatter, which does not make this lens the safest choice in most cases. The frame's PD matches the patient's PD and has an overall proper fit on the patient's face; therefore, there is no induced or unwanted prism present. There was a small change to the patient's overall prescription, which, if the patient is sensitive to change, may require a small amount of time for adjustment; however, this would not cause the appearance of colored fringes."

        }
      ],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "ANSI requirements state that in order for a prescription lens to be deemed as high-impact, it cannot measure less than 2.0 mm thick at its thinnest point, and it must pass the high-velocity impact test. Currently, only materials made from polycarbonate resins adhere to both of these requirements. Previously, lens materials had to be at least 3.0 mm thick; however, with the introduction of polycarbonate, safety lenses can now be made thinner."

      "explanation": "Rx frames that have successfully met the requirements for high-impact and high mass-velocity tests are marked with ”Z87-2+” (along with the manufacturer's trademark) on the front of the frame and both temples. Plano frames that have passed the high-impact test will have a “Z87+” marking. Basic impact rating markings are “Z87-2” for Rx frames, and “Z87” for non-Rx."

The lens must not fracture. If the lens is laminated and its lamina cracks but the lens does not, the lens is considered safe."
