      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "A diagnosis of giant papillary conjunctivitis is characterized by the presence of large papillae (greater than 0.33 mm in size) located on the upper tarsal conjunctiva. GPC is typically associated with a history of contact lens wear, an ocular prosthesis, or corneal surgery with exposed sutures. Although it is most commonly found in patients who are soft contact lens wearers, it may also appear in patients wearing rigid gas permeable lenses (corneal or scleral), but it occurs much less frequently in these cases. Patients with this condition typically present with symptoms of contact lens intolerance, blurred vision, excessive lens movement with blinking, pruritus, and mucous production. Patients may also occasionally experience burning and stinging associated with contact lens wear. The general discomfort that develops in these patients usually occurs after ~2-3 years of previously tolerating contact lenses well. Close examination of the contacts usually reveals deposits of mucous, cellular debris, and microorganisms on the surface of the lenses, which appear to play a pathogenic role in the development of GPC."

      ],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) shows features of both a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction and an immediate type I, IgE mediated reaction. Patients with GPC typically have an increase in inflammatory cells in the epithelium and substantia propria of the conjunctiva that include lymphocytes, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils and plasma cells. These cells eventually release a variety of chemical inflammatory mediators that act locally in the tissue of the conjunctiva to cause vasodilation, edema, and increased production of mucous. Structural cells (epithelial cells and fibroblasts) are involved in both the inflammatory process and tissue remodeling, and eventually result in the formation of the giant papillae. Patients who develop GPC will also exhibit high levels of IgE in their tear film."

        }
      ],
      "answer": "E",
      "explanation": "The exact etiology of the development of GPC remains unclear; however, research has suggested that an immune response is responsible for the observed tissue changes. The controversy lies in the cause of the inflammatory response. Some investigators believe that the inflammation is elicited by an immune reaction to the patient's own tear proteins (from lacrimal fluid) that are presumably denatured by contact lens hygiene solutions. It is thought that these proteins become attached to the contact lens surface when in the eye, and act as antigens to which antibodies may then bind. Additionally, some researchers also believe that mechanical trauma induced by the edges of contact lenses when blinking causes irritation to the upper tarsal conjunctiva, and may also play a role in the development of GPC."

        }
      ],
      "answer": "E",
      "explanation": "Discontinuation of contact lens wear should be the first line of treatment in patients with GPC, with or without the use of topical medications. When topical medications are deemed necessary, a mast cell stabilizer will typically improve symptoms without the need for further medical treatment. However, in cases where GPC is unusually severe, a short-term course of a low-dose topical steroid drop may be considered (loteprednol 0.2% to 0.5% q.i.d). The patient should follow-up in a period of 2-4 weeks for re-evaluation of signs and symptoms. At this time it may be necessary to continue with a mast-cell stabilizer chronically to prevent recurrence of symptoms and to maintain contact lens tolerance. Contact lenses may then be reintroduced once the patient's signs and symptoms have improved. In many cases, clinicians will also recommend daily disposable contact lens wear, or an adjustment to the patient's contact lens hygiene regimen (i.e. changing to a hydrogen peroxide based solution)."

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Patients diagnosed with GPC will typically benefit from changes to their current contact lens regimen.

These include changing solution to a preservative-free or hydrogen peroxide based cleaning system, adding enzymatic cleaners, reducing contact lens wearing time, and more frequently replacing contact lenses (daily disposable lenses are the most preferred)."
