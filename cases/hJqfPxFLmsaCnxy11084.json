      "answer": "E",
      "explanation": "Punctal atresia is a condition in which there is a congenital absence of the punctal opening. If the upper eyelid is affected, the patient will likely be asymptomatic; however, lower lid involvement typically causes epiphora. Punctal stenosis is a narrowing of the puncta that usually occurs secondary to idiopathic causes, use of pharmacological agents, or previous eyelid infections. Patients with canaliculitis typically report excessive tearing unilaterally, along with mucopurulent discharge. Canaliculitis is caused by inflammation of the canaliculus (usually as a result of infection), which results in swelling of the canaliculus and thick concretions that may be expressed from the punctum when pressure is applied. Centurion syndrome occurs as a result of a prominent nasal bridge, causing poor apposition of the medial aspect of the eyelid (including the puncta) with the globe. This condition causes epiphora and is typically observed during childhood/adolescence."

        }

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Patients with symptomatic congenital punctal atresia typically benefit from cannulation with the placement of a silicone tube for several months. In the event that a canaliculus is not present or cannot be located, a conjunctival-lacrimal sac tube may be required. Probing and irrigation is performed when a nasolacrimal duct obstruction is suspected. A saline-filled syringe is inserted into the lower punctum following the instillation of a topical anesthetic. If a hard stop is experienced (the syringe hits the medial wall of the lacrimal sac), or if the injected saline is either tasted by the patient or flows through the nose, there is no obstruction. If saline is not observed or tasted by the patient, a total obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct is suspected. In the latter case, the sac will become extended due to the influx of saline, and there will be regurgitation through the upper punctum. If a soft stop is experienced (the syringe is not in the lacrimal sac) the lacrimal sac will not extend and the injected saline will either reflux through the lower punctum (which is indicative of a lower canalicular obstruction), or it will flow through the upper punctum. If the saline is observed exiting from the upper punctum, there is likely an obstruction of the common canaliculus. Patients who suffer from punctal stenosis may benefit from punctal dilation, a one-snip ampullotomy (small vertical incision of the ampulla), a two-snip procedure (vertical and horizontal incisions to create a larger opening), a laser punctoplasty, or the insertion of canalized plugs. Canaliculitis may be treated with topical antibiotics, but the infection often persists and commonly requires a canaliculotomy."

Some studies have also demonstrated an earlier incidence of cataracts in patients who took Accutane®. Very rare ocular effects include increased intracranial pressure causing papilledema, corneal deposits, and color vision disturbances. Side effects associated with Accutane® use should subside with discontinuation of the medication. Other systemic side effects of Accutane® include: inflammatory bowel disease, birth defects, increased sun sensitivity, liver damage, depression, suicide, bone or muscle pain, changes in hearing, headaches, and severely dry skin."
