      "explanation": "There are several conditions in which there exists a high potential for lens subluxation. These disorders include Marfan's syndrome, homocystinuria, Weill-Marchesani syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Crouzon disease, acquired syphilis, and aniridia, among others. Marfan's sydrome is caused by abnormal connective tissue. People with this condition frequently have crystalline lenses that bilaterally subluxate superiorly and temporally. However, because the lenses are usually still somewhat attached to the zonules, accommodation can remain partially intact. Marfan's syndrome is autosomal dominantly inherited and affects the heart, eyes, and skeletal system. Ocular manifestations include high myopia, lens subluxation, iridodonesis, phacodoneses, premature cataracts, glaucoma, and retinal detachments. It is not uncommon for patients with this condition to be put on high blood pressure medication to decrease strain on blood vessels due to their increased fragility. There are several systemic conditions in which there exists a high potential for crystalline lens subluxation. These disorders include Marfan syndrome, homocystinuria, Weill-Marchesani syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Crouzon disease, acquired syphilis, and aniridia, among others. Marfan syndrome is caused by abnormalities in connective tissue throughout the body. People with this condition frequently have crystalline lenses that bilaterally subluxate superiorly and temporally. However, because the lenses are usually still somewhat attached to the zonules, accommodation can remain partially intact. Marfan syndrome is autosomal dominantly inherited and affects the heart, eyes, and skeletal system.

It is not uncommon for patients with this condition to be put on high blood pressure medication to decrease strain on blood vessels due to their increased fragility. People suffering from homocystinuria typically possess crystalline lenses that subluxate inferiorly and nasally, and they tend to have little to no accommodative capabilities when this occurs. In these patients, the amino acid homocysteine weakens the zonules that are important in supporting the crystalline lens. These patients, like those with Marfan syndrome, are also at a higher risk of developing a retinal detachment."

Patients suffering from Marfan syndrome also commonly display the ocular complications outlined previously, as well as skeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis and atypical rib development, leading to a sunken or protruding breastbone. These patients are usually taller in stature and slender with elongated arms, fingers (arachnodactyly), legs, and toes. They also commonly have flat feet, highly arched palates, and increased joint laxity."
