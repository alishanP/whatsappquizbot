      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "A patient with a branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) will typically present with the following ocular signs and symptoms: ° Sudden, profound, unilateral, painless sectoral visual field loss ° Visual acuity may be variable depending on central retinal involvement ° May have a history of transient visual loss (amaurosis fugax) ° Fundus examination reveals a zone of retinal whitening and superficial opacification along the distribution of the affected branch retinal artery ° Cloudy white retina is a result of associated edema • Corresponds to area of ischemia secondary to the arterial occlusion • Appearance is transient (resolves after a few days); may make diagnosis more difficult ° Narrowing of the arteries may be apparent along with sludging and segmentation of the blood column (box-carring) ° Emboli may be observed in the affected branch retinal artery ° Cotton-wool spots may also appear in the involved area A BRAO results from either embolic or thrombotic occlusion of a branch of the central retinal artery. There are 3 main varieties of emboli (these may be observed upon retinal evaluation): Cholesterol emboli ° Usually arising from the carotid arteries ° Bright reflective crystals are usually observed at a vessel bifurcation Platelet-fibrin emboli ° Associated with large vessel arteriosclerosis Calcific emboli ° Secondary to diseased cardiac valves Patients with a central retinal artery occlusion will also present with unilateral, acute, painless loss of vision; however it is typically more severe than what is observed with a BRAO (counting fingers to light perception in 94% of cases). Fundus evaluation of these patients will reveal superficial opacification or whitening of the retina throughout the entire posterior pole, with a \"cherry-red\" spot representing the center of the macula (may be subtle). This is because the intact choroid stands out below the thin foveola. In some cases, the macula may retain normal color (and central vision may be preserved) in those with a cilioretinal artery, which may still be able to supply blood to the papillomacular bundle despite a CRAO. A cilioretinal artery may be present in up to 20% of the population. It arises from the posterior ciliary circulation, but it supplies the macula and the papillomacular bundle. In cases wherein this artery becomes occluded, patients will typically present with acute, severe loss of central vision. Fundus examination will reveal an area of retinal cloudiness localized to the region typically supplied by the vessel. These types of arterial occlusions most commonly affect younger patients with associated systemic vasculitis. Branch retinal vein occlusions (BRVOs) vary in presentation based upon the amount of macular involvement. Cases in which macular drainage of blood occurs will present with sudden onset of blurred vision and metamorphopsia. If the macula is spared, patients will typically only complain of a relative visual field defect. Fundus evaluation will reveal dilation and tortuosity of the vein distal to the site of occlusion and attenuation proximally. The sector of the retina drained by the obstructed vein will show flame-shaped and dot-blot hemorrhages, retinal edema, and occasional cotton-wool spots. Patients with ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS) will typically report decreased vision with associated periorbital or ocular pain, and a history of transient monocular vision loss (amaurosis fugax). OIS is usually unilateral and most commonly affects men aged 50 to 80 years of age. Retinal examination will reveal dilated and irregular retinal veins and narrowed arterioles. Associated observations include mid-peripheral retinal hemorrhages, iris neovascularization, and posterior segment neovascularization. There may also be concurrent episcleral injection, corneal edema, anterior uveitis, neovascular glaucoma, iris atrophy, cotton-wool spots, spontaneous central retinal artery pulsations, and/or retinal microaneurysms."

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The diagnosis of a branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) can generally be established without fluorescein angiography (FA) on the basis of clinical findings alone; however, an FA may be helpful in the first few hours after an occlusion has occurred, before retinal edema becomes particularly marked. ° In patients undergoing FA, studies will show a delay in the arterial filling phase, with hypofluorescence of the involved area of retina due to blockage of the background choroidal fluorescence by retinal edema ° A central retinal artery occlusion will have this appearance throughout the entire retina, with additional late staining of the optic nerve head ° If the ophthalmic artery is affected, choroidal filling will be absent ° Complete lack of filling of an occluded retinal artery is very rare and occurs in less than 2% of patients"

      "explanation": "Cases of a retinal artery occlusion are considered an ocular emergency because they cause permanent, irreversible vision loss if retinal circulation is not restored prior to the development of an infarction (usually within 90 to 120 minutes after the occlusive event). Studies have shown that no treatment modality has been proven effective in the treatment of retinal artery occlusions (BRAO or CRAO); however, there are anecdotal reports of visual improvement with the following procedures: ° Immediate ocular massage; with fundus contact lens or digital pressure ° Anterior chamber paracentesis ° Acetazolamide (either oral or intravenous) to decrease intraocular pressure ° Hyperventilation into a paper bag ° Induction of respiratory acidosis leading to vasodilation Several days have passed since the onset of symptoms of the retinal arterial occlusion in this particular patient; therefore, the irreversible retinal damage has already occurred and the above options are impractical. Besides referral for treatment of the underlying condition, this patient should initially be checked on every 3 to 6 months to monitor for resolution (ocular neovascularization after BRAO is unlikely)."
