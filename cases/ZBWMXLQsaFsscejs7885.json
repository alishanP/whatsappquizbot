      "explanation": "The modified Thorington technique is performed by placing the test card at 40 cm. A Maddox rod is introduced over the right eye (or left eye) with its axis oriented horizontally. The eye with the Maddox rod is occluded while a penlight is directed through the hole in the center of the card. The patient should report seeing a light and some letters and numbers. It is important that these targets should remain clear throughout the entire test. Unocclude the eye with the Maddox rod (right eye). The patient should now see a red vertical streak that is superimposed upon the Thorington card. Direct the patient's gaze towards the spot of light and ask the patient to note which letters or numbers the horizontal streak is closest to. Flash the penlight on and off, each time asking the patient to inform you where the streak was located. Continue flashing the penlight until two consistent responses are obtained. If the patient has an exo deviation, s/he will report seeing a vertical streak to the left of the spot of light (Maddox rod over the right eye). If the Maddox rod is over the left eye, the streak will be observed to the right of the spot of light. Each optotype represents one prism diopter."

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Sheard's criterion states that in order for a patient to remain asymptomatic, the amount of the reserve fusional vergence (when the patient reports blur) must be twice that of the measured phoria. This patient has 10 prism diopters of exophoria at near and therefore needs at least 20 prism diopters of positive fusional vergence reserve to ensure that she remains asymptomatic. Sheard's criterion applies best to phorias of larger magnitudes."

        }
      ],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The astigmatic clock dial is a technique utilized to test for astigmatism. This method is based on the fact that a target (in our case a black line) that lies parallel to a line focus that is closest to the retina of an eye with astigmatism will appear to be clearer than a line that lies perpendicular to it. Accordingly, the black line of the astigmatic dial that is closest to the least ametropic meridian of an astigmatic eye will appear clearest. The line that is the least in-focus will be located 90 degrees away from this location. Typically, in order to determine the corresponding axis of astigmatism utilizing the clock dial, one must multiply the smallest number of the clearest clock position by 30 degrees. In this case, we must work backwards. The patient's axis of astigmatism is 62 degrees. 62/30 = 2.0666 or 2. Therefore, the 2-8 line will appear clearest to the patient. In general, the line perpendicular to the clearest line is the least clear, as this corresponds to the second principal meridian of the eye. Remember, the principal meridians of the eye are 90 degrees apart. In order for the astigmatic clock dial to work properly, accommodation must be controlled, otherwise the astigmatic interval will shift either forwards or backwards, causing the perception of the clearest line to be altered. Accommodation can be controlled either by fogging (the addition of plus lenses in the phoropter) or, as a last resort, cycloplegia."

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Javal's rule can be used to predict the magnitude of refractive astigmatism based upon keratometry readings. The formula is: refractive astigmatism = (1.25 x the difference in keratometry readings) +/- 0.50 D. If the astigmatism is with-the-rule, 0.50 D is subtracted; if the astigmatism is against-the-rule, 0.50 D is added to the results. If the astigmatism is oblique, 0.50 D is dropped from the equation. Grosvenor et al. (1988) later proposed that dropping the 1.25 factor from the equation yields more accurate results and modified the formula to: refractive astigmatism = the difference in keratometry readings +/- 0.50 D (added or subtracted based upon whether the astigmatism is with- or against-the-rule). Oblique astigmatism simply is thought to be equal to the oblique corneal toricity. Therefore, given the above patient's refractive findings, and taking into account the findings of Grosvenor et al., the closest match would be: OD: 44.50 @ 065 / 45.25 @ 155; OS: 44.75 @ 170 / 46.75 @ 080. The right eye displays 0.75 D of against-the-rule corneal toricity; adding 0.50 (from Grosvenor's work) yields 1.25 D of astigmatism. The left eye depicts 2.00 D of with-the-rule corneal toricity. 2.00 - 0.50 = 1.50 D (remember that the flatter meridian represents the axis of astigmatism)."
