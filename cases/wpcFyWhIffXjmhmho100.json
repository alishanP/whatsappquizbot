      ],
      "answer": "E",
      "explanation": "Progressive addition lenses do not have a segment line like that of a flat-top bifocal lens; however, they still require proper measurements to denote where the graduated power change should begin. The segment height for PALs is measured from the center of the patient's pupil to the bottom of the deepest portion of the lens. Before taking this measurement, you must ensure that the frame is properly adjusted on the patient's face! In order to determine the proper height of a bifocal lens, most clinicians and opticians will adjust the frame and have the patient look over their shoulder (making sure that they are eye level with the patient). Using a dry-erase marker, the lens is dotted at the level of the patient's lower eyelid. This is the bifocal segment height (some clinicians add 0.5 mm to allow for a grooved frame). Trifocals are measured the same way as bifocals, except that the lens is dotted at the lower pupil margin (vs. the eyelid margin)."

          "correct": true
        }
      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "In this case, the segment heights are too high, causing the patient to look through the powers intended for viewing intermediate objects. In order to lower the frame so he is looking through the distance powers of the lenses, you should push or spread the nose pads further apart. This will lower the lenses, hopefully centering the distance Rx in the center of the patient's pupil. If this adjustment does not help, or if there is too much discrepancy between the segment height and the patient's pupil, the lenses may have to be remade with the segment height at the proper location."

          "correct": false
        }
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "An anti-reflective coating allows more light to pass through the lens rather than being reflected off the surface of the lens; this will help the patient with symptoms of glare and subsequent digital eye strain that are common when viewing screens. A light rose or pink tint will also permit more comfortable vision because it helps to offset effects of overhead fluorescent lighting. Individuals who work at computers for long periods of time can become prone to visual fatigue and are encouraged to take frequent breaks from the computer. Proper ergonomics and specifically designed computer glasses can also help to promote a more productive work environment."

          "correct": true
        }
      ],
      "answer": "E",
      "explanation": "Conventional lenses can be decentered so that the optical center of the lens does not correspond with the center of the patient's pupil in order to induce a desired amount of prism; however, for aspheric lenses, prism must be ground into the lens. Aspheric lenses have a base curve that progressively changes from the center of the lens to the edge, allowing for thinner, lighter lenses with less magnification (or minification) experienced by the patient. Plus-powered aspheric lenses are flatter, with front curves that flatten towards the lens edge, while minus-powered aspheric lenses are also flatter, but their front curves steepen towards the periphery. Because aspheric lenses are flatter and sit closer to the patient's eyes, some patients will notice an increase in glare; it is for this reason that it is important to recommend an anti-reflective coating on all aspheric lenses."

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Viewing a grid through a high plus-powered lens causes pincushion distortion because the edges of the grid are more magnified than the center. A high minus-power lens will cause the grid to distort in a barrel-like fashion because the center of the grid is more magnified than the edges."
