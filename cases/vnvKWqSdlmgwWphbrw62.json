      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "When the patient looks down to read through the bifocal portion of his lenses, a vertical imbalance is created that is caused by his anisometropia, resulting in diplopia. This problem can be eliminated by prescribing slab-off prism. Slab-off prism is applied to the most minus or least plus spectacle lens. It is prescribed in this manner because minus lenses are thickest at the edges and slab-off prism is base-up; this helps to minimize the thickness difference between the edge and the center of the lens."

        }
      ],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Use Prentice's rule to solve this problem: prism diopters (Pd) = d x F, where d = the distance from the optical center (in centimeters), and F = the power of the lens in the desired meridian (in diopters). Solving for the amount of prism on the right eye, Pd = 0.7(-4.00) = 2.8 base-down prism Solve for the left eye: Pd = 0.7(-7.50) = 5.25 base-down prism Subtract the two to determine the total prismatic effect experienced by the patient: 5.25 - 2.8 = 2.45 base-down prism In this case, the patient is looking through base-down prism in both eyes, which cancels some of the prismatic effect. Alternatively, you can omit one of the steps by initially determining the total power difference in the vertical meridian between the two lenses, which is 3.50 D (7.50 - 4.00 = 3.50). You can then multiply this power difference by the distance between the patient's line of sight and the optical centers, which is 7 mm in this question. Pd = 0.7(3.5) = 2.45 prism diopters base-down over the left eye Generally, vertical imbalances of smaller magnitudes do not pose too much of a problem for single vision lenses, as the patient can tilt his head to re-align the optical centers with his line of sight, thus eliminating any possible diplopia."

        }
      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Because the patient is experiencing double vision with near activities, there are several options available to help eliminate this problem. Prescribing slab-off prism over the left eye, or reverse slab-off prism (base-down) over the right eye, will help to eliminate the vertical diplopia caused by his anisometropia. Another option to alleviate his issue is to prescribe single vision lenses. With separate single vision lenses for distance and near, the patient’s line of sight will match the optical centers of the lenses more appropriately, decreasing the possibility of a significant vertical imbalance. Alternatively, the patient may be fit with contact lenses. A pair of PALs will not solve this problem because the vertical imbalance will still be present as the patient looks down to read with these types of lenses. Adding base-out prism is not a good solution either, since the patient suffers from vertical (and not horizontal) diplopia. A larger frame will also not have an effect on improving his symptoms."

        }
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "This patient could undergo LASIK with no foreseeable complications given that his topographies and corneal thicknesses are normal. The diplopia experienced by the patient is solely attributable to the anisometropia present in his glasses, which causes a vertical imbalance when he reads. This problem would not persist following LASIK, as his anisometropia would be eliminated. The patient would; however, still need reading glasses to correct his near vision."

        }
      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Increasing the pantoscopic tilt of a pair of glasses will cause an increase in the sphere power. Bending the frame so that the optical center no longer passes through the center of rotation of the eye will also induce astigmatism. The induced astigmatism will have the same axis as the axis of rotation; therefore, increasing the face wrap will induce astigmatism with an axis of roughly 90 degrees. Increasing the pantoscopic tilt will induce astigmatism with an axis of roughly 180 degrees. The power of the induced astigmatism will have the same sign as the sphere. Therefore, if a +4.00 D lens has a 10-degree pantoscopic tilt, the induced cylinder will have a plus sign with an axis of 180 degrees."
