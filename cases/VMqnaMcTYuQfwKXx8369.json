      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A chorioretinal coloboma is a congenital condition caused by an incomplete closure of the embryonic fissure that typically occurs at approximately week 6 of gestation. The inferior retina is affected, as this is the site of closure of the fissure. The optic nerve and/or the macula may be involved resulting in decreased visual acuity. An associated superior visual field defect is also typically observed. Chorioretinal colobomas may be unilateral or bilateral and are frequently seen in conjunction with microphthalmos. The affected area will appear white due to an absence of retinal and choroidal tissue, resulting in visible sclera that may be covered by a layer of blood vessels. The edges of a coloboma are distinct and may possess pigmentation demarcating the transitional area from the defect to normal retina. Posterior staphylomas are excavations or dips around the optic nerve or in the retina that occur secondary to a bulging of weakened sclera posteriorly. Morning glory anomaly is defined as a birth defect of the optic nerve in which there is a coloboma of the optic disc. The coloboma results in a funnel-shaped optic nerve head with a white dot in the center, an elevated ring of pigment surrounding the disc, and vessels that radiate out from the rim in ring-like spokes. Reflection from within the eye may give the appearance of a white pupil. Vision in the affected eye is usually severely impaired. Generally, degenerative myopia may occur when a patient's refractive error is greater than approximately -6.00 D. Typically, the myopic refractive error results from a long axial length. The fundus of a patient with degenerative myopia will often possess an optic nerve that is vertically elongated. Chorioretinal atrophy with an associated temporal myopic conus is frequently noted with the optic nerve as well. Additionally, the underlying choroidal vasculature will be more apparent in this condition."

        }
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Chorioretinal colobomas tend to be stable and static with time and therefore do not require any intervention. Treatment only becomes necessary in the event of a subsequent rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. In this case, the retina is attached, which negates the need for either cryotherapy or the insertion of a scleral buckle. A coloboma is a congenital anomaly and therefore is not attributable to the progression of myopia. Because the patient is correctable to 20/20 in the other eye, there is no need to prescribe low-vision devices. However, spectacles with impact-resistant lenses should be discussed with this patient in order to protect the right eye, as the patient is essentially monocular."

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Patients who have chorioretinal colobomas are at an increased risk for the development of a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and therefore should be educated regarding the signs and symptoms of this condition. The increased potential for the development of chorioretinal neovascularization also exists in these patients. Chorioretinal colobomas may involve the fundus only, or they may extend anteriorly and encompass the ciliary body, zonules and/or iris. If the zonules are involved, the portion of the lens that corresponds to the area of missing zonules may appear flattened."

        }
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Colobomas may be observed in conjunction with microphthalmia. Occasionally, in the area of the coloboma, neuroectodermal tissue may protrude into the orbit and result in the development of a cyst. The cyst may remain small or it may enlarge, pushing the globe superiorly and causing the lower lid to bulge forward (termed microphthalmia with a cyst). One and a half syndrome is a rare condition affecting both eyes, in which one eye cannot move laterally at all, and the other can move only in an outward direction (with nystagmus upon abduction, which occurs on the side contralateral to the lesion); convergence and vertical movements are spared. For example, if the lesion was on the right side, neither eye would have the ability to look to the right, but the left eye would retain the ability to abduct (look left); however, it would display nystagmus in this direction of gaze. Keratoconus causes a thinning and bulging of the cornea that is generally located centrally/inferiorly. It is not an inflammatory condition, and most patients tend to be asymptomatic other than reporting decreased visual acuity. There appears to be a very high correlation between keratoconus and atopy. People who suffer from eczema, allergies, and hay fever tend to display a higher incidence of keratoconus than the rest of the general population. Iridocorneal endothelial syndrome is caused by an abnormal corneal endothelial layer, in which the formation of peripheral anterior synechiae occur. These abnormal adhesions may impede the outflow of aqueous, which may cause a resultant rise in IOP. This condition is typically unilateral."

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Augmentin is resistant to beta-lactamase because it is composed of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate, which is a potassium salt of clavulanic acid. Potassium clavulanate is a compound that inhibits the enzyme beta-lactamase. Clavulanic acid deactivates the enzyme, thereby preserving the beta-lactam ring of amoxicillin and allowing it to maintain its effectiveness in destroying the targeted bacteria."
