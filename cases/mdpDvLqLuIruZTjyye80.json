        }
      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSR) occurs as a result of leakage of fluid from the choriocapillaris into the subretinal area, causing a serous detachment of the neurosensory retina in the region of the macula. There is typically an associated loss of the foveal reflex, a hyperopic shift, a potential relative scotoma, and central metamorphopsia. Fluorescein angiography will reveal hyperfluorescence that appears like a “smoke stack.” Evaluation of the posterior pole will display a blister-like elevation of the neurosensory retina. This condition is most prevalent in patients with high levels of anxiety and stress, those with a type \"A\" personality traits (particularly middle-aged males), patients taking systemic steroids, those with hypertension, and those with systemic lupus erythematosus. Macular degeneration may cause central metamorphopsia and scotomas on Amsler grid testing; however, the fundus images of this patient do not display any signs of drusen, which are characteristic of macular degeneration. This condition is also not typically observed at this age, nor will one generally display a neurosensory detachment on OCT. A full thickness macular hole will cause an absolute scotoma as opposed to a relative scotoma. Visual acuity will generally be much worse than 20/40. OCT imaging would also reveal a complete retinal defect. The fundus would display a dark red spot in the area of the macula, potentially along with yellow precipitates in the RPE. Bull's eye maculopathy is typically observed in patients with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine use, which is common in the treatment of malaria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Similar retinal findings can also occur in patients with AMD, Stargardt disease, and cone dystrophy. A paracentral scotoma may be present in addition to RPE atrophy in a characteristic ring pattern surrounding the fovea (this occurs in more advanced forms of the condition). Visual acuity is variable in these patients."

      ],
      "answer": "E",
      "explanation": "Intervention is rarely ever required, as CSR tends to spontaneously regress without treatment within a period of approximately 6 months. Should the patient experience poor visual acuity levels for longer than 4 months, or if the patient wishes to hasten the recovery period (especially for occupational reasons), photocoagulation may be performed to the area of RPE leakage, provided that the area of leakage is not within the foveal avascular zone. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is another treatment that can be considered in chronic cases of CSR. PDT causes endothelial damage and vascular hypoperfusion to inhibit the choroidal hyperpermeability seen in CSR; however, it does not come without risks."
