      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Axons of the nerve fiber layer generally become myelinated just after they pass posteriorly through the lamina cribrosa. Occasionally, oligodendrocytes will enter the eye during embryogenesis causing myelination of the nerve fiber layer. This will appear as a whitened nerve fiber layer with feathery margins that usually extends from the optic disc. In general, axons within the retina should not be myelinated. In most cases, individuals that display this condition are asymptomatic; however, depending on the extent of the retinal involvement and the location, an associated visual field defect may be present. Drusen of the optic nerve is generally bilateral, however, it may present unilaterally. Early in life, the drusen may be located deep beneath the surface of the optic disc, causing the appearance of pseudopapilledema, except that the disc should not appear hyperemic and surface vessels should remain visible. As time passes, the drusen may become more prominent, move towards the surface of the disc, and become exposed, causing the margins of the nerve to appear irregular. The drusen will stay confined to the nerve area. Drusen of the optic nerve may also cause a visual field defect. A diagnosis of vitritis is incorrect because the areas of concern are localized to the retinal tissue and the vitreous remains uninvolved. Ischemic events typically involve superficial hemorrhages of the retina, retinal edema, cotton wool spots, and potential optic disc swelling. In these cases, the patient's visual acuity is often poor, although it may be unaffected depending on the severity of the ischemia."

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Myelination of the nerve fiber layer can be associated with amblyopia, strabismus, nystagmus, optic neuritis, neovascularization of the retina, and myopia. Ellis et al. observed that 83% of eyes with myelinated nerve fibers also possessed more than 6 diopters of myopia. Whether myopia causes myelination of nerve fibers or vice-versa remains to be determined. It has been postulated that myelination may cause a blurring of vision, which acts as a stimulant to axial growth, resulting in the development of myopia. Conversely, axial elongation is related to a delay in the formation of the lamina cribrosa. The lamina cribrosa is thought to act as a barrier against myelination, and if scleral formation is abnormal, this could potentially lead to myelinated nerve fibers."

If the condensing lens is not centered or not aligned with the common visual axis, or if the lens is located too close to the patient's eye, an optimal image will not be achieved. Tilting of the lens will also adversely affect the image quality."
