      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Talc retinopathy can occur with IV drug use of substances such as cocaine and heroin. Retinal vessel deposits typically result from the fillers that are added to these drugs. These substances often initially become caught in the lung tissue, resulting in pulmonary hypertension. In order to compensate for this, collateral vessels can develop and permit venous return that partially bypasses the lungs and travels directly to the heart. As the talc travels through the circulatory system, it can become trapped in the small retinal capillaries. Generally, visual acuity remains unaffected in these cases; however, the capillaries can become blocked, leading to areas of non-perfusion. Talc can also deposit in the small blood vessels of the lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lymph nodes. Pulmonary complications may arise from talc deposits, such as edema and fibrosis. It is believed that if talc is present in the lungs, then significant foreign body damage to the tissue has already occurred. It is important to ensure pulmonary health; therefore, x-rays of the lungs should be ordered in these cases. If retinal ischemia is suspected, fluorescein angiography should be performed to evaluate for possible vascular leakage or non-perfusion."

      "explanation": "Because the patient's visual acuity remains unaffected, and there are no apparent retinal complications, no treatment is necessary at this time. The patient should be evaluated by a pulmonary specialist; however, even in the absence of retinal complications caused by the deposition of talc, as there is likely to be some sort of pulmonary function deficiency. Also, it is important to ensure that the patient is no longer using drugs; the patient should be educated on the effects and complications caused by IV drug use. If the patient is abusing drugs, appropriate counseling should be sought."

      "explanation": "Amitriptyline belongs to the class of medication known as tricyclic antidepressants, which is used in the management of depression. Its mechanism of action involves blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. This may cause any or all of the following side effects: weight gain, dry mouth, dry eyes, drowsiness, blurred vision, dizziness, urinary retention, fatigue, headache, increased appetite, confusion, constipation, tachycardia, hypotension, nausea, seizures, and photosensitivity. Due to the large number of possible side effects, newer alternative antidepressants are typically prescribed before tricyclic antidepressants, although the tricyclic line of therapy is still used when other options have failed."
