        }
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Clinical signs of idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) include subretinal red-orange, polyp-like lesions that are present in the choroidal vasculature, and are typically observed in the peripapillary region (however, they may be observed in the macular area as well). Along with the vascular lesions, other associated signs may be present, such as subretinal or sub-RPE blood, vitreous hemorrhages, circinate subretinal exudates, subretinal fibrosis, subretinal fluid, choroidal neovascular membranes, and multiple serous pigment epithelial detachments. This retinal condition is more commonly observed in African-American and Asian populations and approximately 50% of cases resolve spontaneously. If, however, there are repeated bouts of bleeding and leakage, decreased visual acuity due to macular injury may result. Treatment includes observation, photodynamic therapy (PDT), intravitreal anti-VEGF injections, or combination therapy. PCV lesions can resemble a choroidal neovascular membrane; therefore, this condition is often initially mistaken for AMD. Some factors that can help distinguish between the two are that RPE detachments observed in PCV generally involve lipids, which are not characteristic of AMD. In addition, PCV patients typically will not possess the disciform scar that is commonly observed in patients with neovascular AMD. Lastly, indocyanine green angiography in a patient with AMD will not display evidence of choroidal vascular polypoidal terminals. Idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy also usually occurs at a younger age without significant drusen or geographic atrophy. Although central serous retinopathy can present with pigment epithelial detachments, the polyp-like lesions will be absent, as will exudates, hemorrhages, and choroidal neovascular membranes."

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), with its ability to highlight choroidal vasculature, is the standard test for diagnosis of PCV. There are typically two different types of abnormal blood vessels observed in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; networks of vessels with terminal polyps or aneurysmal dilations of small caliber blood vessels (such as capillaries). The polypoidal endings may frequently be observed in groups; the appearance of which resembles bunches of grapes. Normal fluorescein angiography does not reveal the extent of the abnormal vessels in PCV because the fluorescence of the choriocapillaris will often mask the underlying lesions. ICGA fluoresces in the infrared spectrum (835 nm), which permits better evaluation of the choroidal vasculature. During ICGA, the polyps in PCV will present as focal hyperfluorescent spots initially. In later stages, a reversal pattern of the dye is observed, with the center of the lesion becoming hypofluorescent and the surrounding hyperfluorescent. Finally, in the very last stage of ICGA, there is a “wash-out” of the lesion that is observed in non-leaking PCV lesions."

      "explanation": "Originally, this condition was thought to be observed predominantly in middle-aged black women, but more recent theories suggest that it occurs equally in males and females. It has also been shown that this condition often appears more frequently in people who are more darkly pigmented, particularly Asian populations, indicating a possible genetic correlation."

Optometrists are responsible for recognizing signs of abuse and neglect in children, the elderly, and dependent adults. If abuse is suspected, it must be reported to the appropriate agencies in accordance with state laws."
