Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) • Clinical findings typically include pale optic disc, attenuated retinal arterioles, typical bone-spicule-like pigmentation, and posterior subcapsular cataracts • X-linked RP may show an appearance of prominent choroidal vessels that is similar to choroideremia; however, patients with x-linked RP typically have a reduction in central visual acuity much earlier in life Ocular albinism • Distinguishable clinical findings commonly include decreased vision, nystagmus, and iris transillumination defects • Absence of nyctalopia • Normal electroretinographic amplitudes Myopic retinal degeneration • May mimic choroideremia, however, myopic degeneration is usually not as diffuse as the lesions of choroideremia • Patients suffering from myopic retinal degeneration do not typically complain of night blindness Gyrate atrophy • Clinical presentation may resemble choroideremia, but it is typically a much milder course • Inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive • The atrophic borders appear well-defined and scalloped • Associated with hyperornithinemia"

Patients diagnosed with tyrosinase negative ocular albinism commonly present with iris transillumination defects, which are not associated with choroideremia. Systemic associations that may be correlated with choroideremia include mental deficiency, acrokeratosis, anhidrosis, skeletal deformities, obesity, congenital deafness, hypopituitarism, distal motor neuropathies, and dental deformities."

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choroideremia is described as an x-linked recessive disorder that is caused by mutations in the CHM gene that encodes for the Rab escort protein 1 (REP1). This type of inheritance pattern means that traits of this disease are not clinically manifested when there is a normal copy of the gene. Therefore, all traits associated with x-linked recessive disorders are fully evident in males because they only possess one copy of the chromosome which carries the abnormal gene (and not a normal copy to compensate for the mutated copy). For this reason, women are typically only carriers of these types of diseases and are rarely affected by x-linked recessive disorders unless they have 2 copies of the mutated allele (this would only occur if the mother is a carrier and father is positive for the disease). X-linked recessive disorders have the following characteristic patterns. • There is no father to son transmission • There is father to daughter transmission; all daughters will be carriers • There is mother to daughter transmission so that one half of the daughters will be carriers • There is mother to son transmission so that one half of her sons will be positive for the condition • These hold true if only 1 parent is positive for the mutation"

        }
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Although the progression of this condition is highly variable, visual acuity in patients diagnosed with choroideremia is often not notably affected until the 6th or 7th decade of life, or in some cases, even later. It is likely that patients will have some mild loss of acuity due to the appearance of pigmentary changes in the macular region and mild degenerative maculopathy; however, central visual acuity often remains favorable until later in life. Constriction of the visual fields that occurs earlier in life accounts for the majority of the patient's symptoms, and typically progresses at a much faster rate."

      "explanation": "The most common entering complaint in patients with early signs of choroideremia is nyctalopia, or night blindness. This typically occurs in patients in the first decade of life and is usually the cause of further investigation that leads to the diagnosis of choroideremia. Restriction of peripheral vision usually occurs shortly thereafter, and continues to progress throughout the patient's life. As previously mentioned, central visual acuity typically remains favorable until around the 6th decade of life, at which point it rapidly begins to degenerate as well."
