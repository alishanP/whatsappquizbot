      "answer": "F",
      "explanation": "True field expansion for patients with hemianopic visual field defects can be achieved using the Peli lens, a fitting philosophy by Dr. Eli Peli. To achieve the desired effect, two 40 prism diopter Fresnel prisms in small rectangular segments are used. For a right hemianopsia, they are placed on the right lens in the base-out direction. For a left hemianopsia, they are placed over the left lens in a base-out fashion. The segments should be placed 7 mm above and 7 mm below the middle of the pupil. The purpose of the prisms are to move light from the non-seeing field into the seeing field, thus alerting the patient of an object in the non-seeing field and providing a cue for the patient to scan the environment. Once a patient successfully learns how to use the Fresnel prisms, they can be replaced with special-order ground in 40 diopter prism segments. Ten base-out prism over each eye will only cause convergence. The option of placing 10 BO over the left eye and 10 BI over the right will cause a shift in the field, but it will not actually expand the field of view. This type of prism is sometimes used when a patient suffers from midline shift or hemi-field neglect."

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "When positioned correctly, the 40 diopter Fresnel prisms should provide approximately 20 degrees of field expansion (one degree for every 2 diopters of prism). Once the patient adapts to the Fresnel prisms, permanent prisms may be made into the lenses via special order through Chadwick Optical."

      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "In patients with significant visual field defects, lined bifocals are typically preferred over progressive additional lenses. The patient also mentioned feeling like her vision was dimmer, so improving contrast would benefit her as well. This can be achieved with a yellow fit-over filter or with a yellow acetate sheet overlayed on top of reading material. When prescribing the Peli prismatic lens treatment, reach and touch training is needed to help the patient become aware of the spatial shift between an object's apparent location and its true location in space. The patient has excellent acuity and thus does not require the use of a telescope (which would only serve to further constrict her field of view). The patient is not complaining of photophobia, and her pupils are capable of regulating the amount of light that reaches the retina, thereby negating the need for a contact lens with a pinhole aperture. Also, because the patient is capable of adequate near vision with a reading add over her distance correction, she does not require the use of high magnification devices. These types of visual aids are best reserved for patients with poor macular function."

        }
      ],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Legal blindness is a definition established by the federal government in the Social Security Act. It takes into account best corrected visual acuity in the better-seeing eye based upon a Snellen 20 ft chart. This patient's best corrected visual acuity is 20/20 in each eye; therefore, she is not legally blind based upon visual acuity. Legal blindness based upon visual fields is defined as a field in which the widest diameter subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees. This patient's visual field is larger than 20 degrees, and thus she is not considered legally blind by this definition either."
